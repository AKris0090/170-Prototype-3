      <p>Autumn, the weather has turned from sweet to bitter. The dioxide visible as you exhale, lungs aching from the cold, and hands likewise. Autumn is usually a little bit warmer with him at your hip. Cyrus. You’ve been together since you started college together, and have spent every moment from holidays to failed midterm crash outs, you know him. Which is also how you know he’s hiding something.<br> <br>

        When you’re together he’s always checking his phone like he’s waiting for something, and now when you look at him with endearment the same look isn’t often returned.<br><br>
        
        You and Cyrus are studying at the library together. Not a word spoken to each other. Something breaks the silence, Cyrus’s phone vibrates on the table. It’s close to you so you grab it, but before you can get a look at the notification he reaches over and snatches it from you. <br><br>
        
        “What the hell was that?”, You ask him.<br><br>
        
        “None of your business”, he replies bluntly.<br><br>
        
        “Un-fucking-believable, you’re so god damn shady”, you say as you storm out of the library.<br><br>
        
        Laptop and charger in hand you call your best friend Gabriella.<br><br>
        
        “Girl, Cyrus is cheating on me and I know it in my heart of hearts, I know you’re good with computers so you’ve got to know some way I can get into his snap"<br><br>
        
        Your friend gives you a website to download all of his account information: photos, password, username, chats and everything. But when you hit the download button your files get corrupted.<br><br>
        
        “Gabby the files got corrupted what do I do?”<br><br>
        
        “Don’t worry his information is still in there you just have to look!”</p><br>
